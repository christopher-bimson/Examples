# Examples

I often find myself coding up small examples of
approaches or technology for illustrative purposes.

Rather than redo them on an ad-hoc basis, I'm going 
to start keeping them here.

## Selenium Page Objects

This is a very simple demonstration of the [Selenium
Page Object pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html), 
using Google search as the example system under test.
The tests are built with [Xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) and [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions)
which are nice tools, but not the point of the example.
